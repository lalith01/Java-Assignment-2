Q9: Why is it said that searching a node in a binary search tree is efficient than that of simple binary
tree.

Ans: Using a binary search tree, length of tree traversal is reduced by comparing the search value with
the root. The traversal path is reduced using this comparison , if the search value is greater than the root
then the right side is traversed and left side is traversed in case of lower value.
Hence the searching complexity of binary tree O(n) is reduced to O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
