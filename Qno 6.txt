Q6: What is the difference between an array and stack?

Ans: The main difference between an array and stack is how they return the values, in an array we can
access an index of an element and get the data whereas in a stack, the data is returned in a first in last
out fashion, that is that the data that went in first is the last in order when we get data from the stack.
