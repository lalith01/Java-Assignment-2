Q3. What are the advantages of a Linked List over an array?
Ans: The size of a linked list is dynamic whereas for an array it is static. Linked Lists can also store
generic objects where as for an array the data types of its constituents should be the same. Linked Lists
are also flexible and we can create other data structures such as circular linked lists, doubly linked lists
etc.
